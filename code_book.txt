Code Book - UCI Human Activity Recognition Data Set

This data is extracted and simplified from the original data set found here: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
with 561 variables for each observation of a subject and activity.  

The 561 variables, and the methods used to achieve them, are described in the features.txt and features_info.txt files included in the zipped data file.   

The reduced data set includes 69 variables:

1: subject_id
		1-30	Unique subject identifier
2: activity_id
		Id number 1-6, corresponding to the following physical activities
		1   Walking
		2	Walking up stairs
		3   Walking down stairs
		4	Sitting
		5   Standing
		6   Laying
3-68: extracted data
		Variables are of the form aaaa_bbbb_ccc_dddd_eeee_f
		describing the type of measurement taken, where
		aaaa: 	time
				freq 	(frequency)
		bbbb:	body
				grav 	(gravity)
		cccc: 	acc 	(accelerometer)
				gyr 	(gyroscopic)
		dddd:	jerk
				mag     (magnitude)
				jerk_mag (jerk magnitude)
		eeee: 	mean
				stdv  	(standard deviation)
		f: 		x       (x-axis)
				y       (y-axis)
				z       (z-axis)
		aaaa, bbbb, cccc, and eeee are always present; dddd and f may or may not be.
69: activity_name
		Activities as defined by their id number in activity_id
		Walking
		Walking up stairs
		Walking down stairs
		Sitting
		Standing
		Laying

When choosing new variable names, every attempt was made to adhere to Hadley Wickham's style guidelines (http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html).
